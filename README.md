This was my very first project I did on my own ever. It was a while back, I didn't have much experience, I only just recently started back then. I heavily used bootstrap to
create this project. I only knew html/CSS at this point. I was proud of it! Sadly I stopped learning after this project! but 9 months later I was back and 100% committed! 
    -Hope you are having a great day!
